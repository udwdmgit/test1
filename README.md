# test1
A test repository for experimentation.
I'm in the process of learing how github works. I will add more to his later. 
It's a pretty borring test example at the moment. It will get better with time!
I do like how this works. The learning curve does not appear to be too rough, but
it will take some time to master this platform. Over time this example will grow
and look much better.

I recently added some MATLAB scripts.
